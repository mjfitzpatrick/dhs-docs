Convert dhsSendPixelData() to write to a socket instead of a file.  Use this
routine and the driver to really assess bandwidth and latency on the 1Gpbs
link between pipedevn and pipen1.

cc -o server timing.c proto_server.c  		(run this on pipen1)
cc -o client proto.c proto_driver.c  		(run this on pipedevn)

Usage:
 
client data_filename

server {optional port}  - default 9099
