NEWFIRM DHS Status

    o 	Major staffing shakeup after months of little progress
	mean we're only now just starting design & development

    o	Development Plan 
	-  Complete design & implementation of DHS interface to
	   Monsoon/NOCS components.  These include client, server
	   and supervisor levels which provide basic data transport
	   and communication to/from the DHS
	-  Implement data-side "last-resort" disk storage format and
	   recovery procedure.  Recovering failed transfers will
	   simulate data feed from instrument, providing independent
	   means (i.e. dummy feed) for testing/development of DHS
	-  Implement minimal DHS-side functionality (e.g. write MEF
	   to disk) to provide a "complete" system as far as NEWFIRM
	   software is concerned and close the loop between instrument
	   and DHS development.
	-  Expect working lab system by end of calendar year

        -  Simultaneously:
	   -  Flesh-out design of full DHS, Quick Look, Quick Reduce, 
	      pipeline, archive and astronomer interfaces
	   -  Implementation to proceed start of calendar 05
