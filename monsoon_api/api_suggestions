Suggested changes to Monsoon/DHS API
------------------------------------
* Replace openConnect() with openObservation(), which will pass the dither
  pattern and number of exposures for the observation set. Likewise, replace
  closeConnect() with closeObservation().  The effect of a client calling
  openObservation() will still be to establish a communication channel from
  the PAN to the DHS collector.  Except that the information, dither pattern
  and number of expected exposures, must come from NOCS not PAN... Hmmm.
  openObservation() is associated with an activity in the domain, as opposed
  to openConnect() which is in solution space (referring to the distributed
  system).
