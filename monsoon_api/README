This is an implementation of the Monsoon to DHS API that implements
dhsSendPixelData() and dhsSendMetaData(), but it simply writes the data 
it receives to a file that is named by using obs_id concatenated with 
monsoon star date (exposure id).  It prepends the metadata to the first of
the file.  Relevant files are proto.c (implements dhsSendPixelData()) and
send_meta.c and proto_driver.c, although the Monsoon dhsUtil.h is also
needed.

g++ -fpic -c send_meta.c send_pixel.c
g++ -shared -o libdhs.so send_meta.o send_pixel.o
g++ proto_driver.c -L. -ldhs -o driver

User must set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to fullpath to libdhs.so.

int dhsSysOpen (long *status, char *response, int numInstances);

g++ -g -fpic -c dhsSysOpen.c
g++ -shared -o libdhs.so dhsSysOpen.o
g++ -g driver.c -L. -ldhs -o driver

To run this driver, one must start the supervisor on the machine specified
in the environment variable DHS_SUPERVISOR. Also, it is not required, but 
preferrable to set up SSH tunneling to avoid needing to enter a passwd.
In addition, you must alter your .cshrc $PATH to include the directory 
where the executables live for each machine you wish to run Collectors on.

g++ collector.cc dhs_util.c -o collector

g++ -fpic -c farm.cc
g++ supervisor.c farm.o -o supervisor
