Design Notes

Fri Jun  3 11:48:51 MST 2005:
   Still getting a farm that is empty in registerCollector() after filling
   it in startCollector().  Just realized that the parent data struct is not
   being updated from the child startCollector(). So even though, 
   registerCollector() is forked after startCollector() fills farm, it is
   only seeing an empty farm (because that is what the parent has).  Solution:
   add shmem with locking.
